New York City Marathon - Capstone Project

Motivation:

I have been a runner for over 18 years  and it is a huge part of who I am and what has motivated me throughout my life. I ran the NYC marathon 4 years ago and want to analyze the results data over the last 5 years to see how the results vary over time. In addition, I will see if  there are any correlations with age groups and gender. I will also explore more behind the results and pull in other datasets to uncover insights about the runners and potential trends that correlate with their environment and economy.


Data Questions:

How do the NYC marathon results vary over the last 5 years?
Are there trends in age group and gender throughout the years?
Is there a relationship between result times and wealth of an area?
Is there a correlation with weather on race day and performance?


Known Issues and Challenges:

I have run into some data issues as far as gathering all of the NYC marathon results. After web scraping the results for the last 5 years, I was only able to obtain results for the first 10k runners in each of these races. This race has over 50k runners per year. I decided to do my analysis using the first 10k finishers of each race.
