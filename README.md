# nyc-marathon-capstone

Motivation:

I have been a runner for over 18 years of my life and it is a huge part of who I am and what has motivated me throughout my life. I ran the NYC marathon 4 years ago and will analyze the results data over the last 5 years to see how the results vary over time. In addition, I will see if  there are any correlations with age groups and gender. I will also explore more behind the results and pull in other datasets to uncover insights about the runners, their training, and potential trends that correlate with their environment and economy. 

Questions: 

How do the NYC marathon results vary over time?
Are there trends in age group and gender for faster race times throughout the years? 
Is there a relationship between result times and wealth of an area? 
Is there a correlation with weather on race day and performance?
